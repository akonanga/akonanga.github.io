## Neighborhood Map Project

### How will I complete this Project?

1.  Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
1.  Download the [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).
1.  Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
1.  Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
1.  Implement the search bar functionality to search your map markers.
1.  Implement a list view of the identified locations.
1.  Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
